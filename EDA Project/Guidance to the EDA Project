Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Layoff Data in MySQL
This guide demonstrates the process of cleaning and preparing data on company layoffs for analysis in MySQL. The steps included creating databases and tables, removing duplicates, standardizing data, handling null values, and removing irrelevant columns. 
1. I created a Database and named it Projects

2. The layoff data csv file was imported into MySQL

3. Imported data was checked to know the general scope of the data

4. A Staging Table was created so as to enable me keep the raw file as a contingency plan

5. Duplicate Rows were identified using a CTE and Windows functions

6. A Second Staging Table was created for safe removal of duplicates

7. Duplicate Rows were then safely deleted

8. Standardizing Data: the following steps were taken

a) Whitespaces in the company Column were removed using the TRIM function

b) Inconsistent names in the industry columns were identified by first selecting the DISTINCT industry and were standardized to make them consistent across the dataset

c) The country column was standardized by removing trailing periods in the country name "United States"

d) The data type for the date column was changed from text to date format, and the column type was modified to date

9. The data was checked for blank or null values in key columns

10. Blank industry names for companies with multiple rows were imputed by inference of the other rows

11. Columns that were irrelevant to the analysis were removed

12. Final checks were done by verifying the cleaned data.

By following these steps, I cleaned and prepared the layoff data for further analysis.
